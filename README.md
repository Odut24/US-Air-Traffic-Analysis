## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
- Total Airports – 1,022
- Total Airlines - 705
- Total Flights – 4.59bn
- Foreign Gateways – 1,669

## Insights Gained:
- Total Flights By Airports
- Total Flights by foreign Gateway
- Total Flights by Airline
- Total Charter and Scheduled Flights
- Carrier-group Ratio
- Total Monthly Flights
- Total Yearly Flights

## Recommendations:
· Optimize Flight Scheduling Based on Demand: Adjust flight schedules to match seasonal and monthly demand trends, prioritizing high-demand routes to maximize occupancy and revenue.
· Increase Charter Flights on High-Volume Routes: Expand charter flight offerings for routes with consistently high passenger counts to enhance service flexibility and meet peak travel needs.
